        <p>I'm a Portuguese Computer Science student with two degrees in electronics.</p>
        <p>People that I work with say I'm talented. I call it hard work and sweat. </p>
        <p>Started programming in 2016 with C++ applied to ATMega microcontrollers. Since there, I've been learning more languages and frameworks to develop my skills in this field.</p>
        <p>I've worked as a Software/Hardware developer in two companies, being one of them a research institute in Portugal.</p>
        <p> Right now I'm working as an Applications Engineer at Unipartner Portugal.</p>
        <p>I always find to help people developing their projects and even try to contribute and use open-source as much as possible.</p>
