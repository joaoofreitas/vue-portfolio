        <p>As told in the "About me" section, I have two minor degrees in electronics (even though that programming is what I enjoy to do mostly). One of them I took it in my high school and the other one on the University of Madeira, completing it in 2020. </p>
        <p>I continued to study electronics due to my affection in robotics and IoT (Internet of Things) projects.</p>
        <p>Electronics isn't what I want to do for a living since I have a stronger passion for software. Nevertheless, it was the path I took and I wouldn't go back to change anything. Since I know how things work in the low-level and it gives me another perspective and advantage compared to some other programmers. Also, it gives me the power to build anything I want since home automation projects to sensor data collection.</p>
        <p>Electronics is essential in my career, especially developing IoT (Internet of Things projects).</p>
