        <p>I've earned some kind love for servers since I started realizing how powerful they are, and how important they are in simple daily tasks.</p>
        <p>As a GNU/Linux user since 2016, it was fairly easy to understand how servers work and how to manage them, since the terminal commands are the same.</p>
        <p>I started to learn how Docker works, and why is it so important nowadays in servers, getting to the conclusion that containerization is essential in server managing.</p>
        <p>After some projects and course subjects related to computer networking, I also noticed that I like the way networking works. So much that in a near future, I want to take the Cisco CCNA certification.</p>
