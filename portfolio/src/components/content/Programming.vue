        <p>I'm always looking forward to learning and improving my code skills. Either by learning a new programming language, framework or rewriting code to improve code standards.</p>
        <p>I currently work quite frequently with four main programming languages, being them C#, C++, Python and JavaScript. </p>
        <p>I usually use C and C++ for microcontroller programming such as the ESP family and the ATMega family, even though I've worked with other families of microcontrollers before. I use Python for fast scripting projects or simple bots that can help me in daily tasks in my server systems or even in my desktops. For JavaScript, mostly NodeJS applications using the HTTP protocol, even TCP/UDP sockets, server-side scripting and even some front-end frameworks like ReactJS and VueJS.</p>
        <p>I'm willing to learn Go to use it as a more efficient, compiled version of some of my projects that rely on networking to handle stuff.</p>
