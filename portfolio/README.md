### About me 
I'm a Portuguese Computer Science student with two degrees in electronics.

People that I work with say I'm talented. I call it hard work and sweat. 

Started programming in 2016 with C++ applied to ATMega microcontrollers. Since there, I've been learning more languages and frameworks to develop my skills in this field.

I've worked as a Software/Hardware developer in two companies, being one of them a research institute in Portugal.

I always find to help people developing their projects and even try to contribute and use open-source as much as possible.

### Programming
I'm always looking forward to learning and improving my code skills. Either by learning a new programming language, framework or rewriting code to improve code standards.

I currently work quite frequently with four main programming languages, being them C, C++, Python and JavaScript. 

I usually use C and C++ for microcontroller programming such as the ESP family and the ATMega family, even tho I've worked with other families of microcontrollers before. I use Python for fast scripting projects or simple bot's that can help me in daily tasks in my server systems or even in my desktops. For JavaScript, mostly NodeJS applications using the HTTP protocol, even TCP/UDP sockets, server-side scripting and even some front-end frameworks like ReactJS and VueJS.

I'm willing to learn Go to use it as a more efficient, compiled version of some of my projects that rely on networking to handle stuff.

### Server Management
I've earned some kind love for servers since I started realizing how powerful they are, and how important they are in simple daily tasks.

As a GNU/Linux user since 2016, it was fairly easy to understand how servers work and how to manage them, since the terminal commands are the same.

I started to learn how Docker works, and why is it so important nowadays in servers, getting to the conclusion that containerization is essential in server managing.

After some projects and course subjects related to computer networking, I also noticed that I like the way networking works. So much that in the recent future, I want to take the Cisco CCNA certification.

### Electronics
As told in the "About me" section, I have two minor degrees in electronics (even though that programming is what I enjoy to do mostly). One of them I took it in my high school and the other one on the University of Madeira, completing it in 2020. 

I continued to study electronics due to my affection in robotics and IoT (Internet of Things) projects.

Electronics isn't what I want to do for a living since I have a stronger passion for Software. Nevertheless, I was the path I took and, I wouldn't go back to change anything, since I know how things work in the low-level and it gives me another perspective and advantage compared to some other programmers. Also, it gives me the power to build anything I want since home automation projects to sensor data collection.

Electronics is essential in my career, especially developing IoT (Internet of Things projects).
